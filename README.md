# Deep Learning History Website

This repository includes the source code and content for a website exploring the evolution of deep learning models from their roots in the 1940s to fruition in the 1980s.

## Overview

This *incomplete* website aims to provide an interactive historical journey through the progression of machine learning into deep learning. Visuals and Python code are included for each model. 

## Features

* Visualizations with links to their sources for interactivity
* Explanations of deep learning concepts and algorithms
* Historical Context
* Links to Python code for each model
